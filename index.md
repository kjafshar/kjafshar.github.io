<h2> Building Image Classifier </h2>

For this project I combined google's apis with MTC data and a nueral net image classifier

<h2> Municipal Code Crawler </h2>

As part of my work at MTC we developed a crawler which gathers the municipal code documents of approximately 100 municipalities around the San Francisco Bay Area. These documents are stored in a redshift database using code from MTC's tool kit, and new version of the documents are crawled and stored on a regular basis.

Check out the code [here](https://github.com/kjafshar/scraping_muni_codes)

<h2> Random Forest Classifier & Regressor </h2>

During my courses in Machine Learning I built a random forest regressor and classifier using numpy and object oriented python. First I built a Decision tree object which when fit on a data set splits the data to reduce the given loss function. Then a "forest" of these trees are created with additional features to randomize the data available to each tree, and ultimately the vote of each individual is accounted for before producing a single prediction.
