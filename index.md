<h2> Building Image Classifier </h2>

For this project I combined google's apis with MTC data and a nueral net image classifier

<h2> Municipal Code Crawler </h2>

As part of my work at MTC we developed a crawler which gathers the municipal code documents of approximately 100 municipalities around the San Francisco Bay Area. These documents are stored in a redshift database using code from MTC's tool kit, and new version of the documents are crawled and stored on a regular basis.

Check out the code <a href="https://github.com/kjafshar/scraping_muni_codes" target="_blank">here</a>

<h2> Random Forest Classifier & Regressor </h2>

During my courses in Machine Learning I built a random forest regressor and classifier using numpy and object oriented python. First I built a Decision tree object which when fit on a data set splits the data to reduce the given loss function. Then a "forest" of these trees are created with additional features to randomize the data available to each tree, and ultimately the vote of each individual is accounted for before producing a single prediction.

<h2> Kmeans Clustering </h2>

Using numpy I developed a kmeans clustering system which is can be used in a number of ways. These included of course grouping together coordinates in n dimmensions, compressing images into lower numbers of colors, and using clusters of points to assign labels.

\* Some of my projects were written in as part of academic and/or professional projects. As a result I cannot post this code publically, but I will share them with those who are interested on an individual basis. This is to respect the academic integrity of future classes and the privacy/property of my colleagues.

  <h2>Fixed Full-height Side Nav</h2>
  <h3>Try to scroll this area, and see how the sidenav sticks to the page</h3>
  <p>Notice that this div element has a left margin of 25%. This is because the side navigation is set to 25% width. If you remove the margin, the sidenav will overlay/sit on top of this div.</p>
  <p>Also notice that we have set overflow:auto to sidenav. This will add a scrollbar when the sidenav is too long (for example if it has over 50 links inside of it).</p>
