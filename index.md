  <h2> Building Image Classifier </h2>

  For this project I combined google's apis with MTC data and a nueral net image classifier

  <h2> Municipal Code Crawler </h2>

  As part of my work at MTC we developed a crawler which gathers the municipal code documents of approximately 100 municipalities around the San Francisco Bay Area. These documents are stored in a redshift database using code from MTC's tool kit, and new version of the documents are crawled and stored on a regular basis.

  Check out the code <a href="https://github.com/kjafshar/scraping_muni_codes" target="_blank">here</a>

  <h2> Random Forest Classifier & Regressor </h2>

  During my courses in Machine Learning I built a random forest regressor and classifier using numpy and object oriented python. First I built a Decision tree object which when fit on a data set splits the data to reduce the given loss function. Then a "forest" of these trees are created with additional features to randomize the data available to each tree, and ultimately the vote of each individual is accounted for before producing a single prediction.

  <h2> Kmeans Clustering </h2>

  Using numpy I developed a kmeans clustering system which is can be used in a number of ways. These included of course grouping together coordinates in n dimmensions, compressing images into lower numbers of colors, and using clusters of points to assign labels.

  \* Some of my projects were written in as part of academic and/or professional projects. As a result I cannot post this code publically, but I will share them with those who are interested on an individual basis. This is to respect the academic integrity of future classes and the privacy/property of my colleagues.
